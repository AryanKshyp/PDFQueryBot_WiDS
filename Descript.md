# Description

PDFQueryBot is a chatbot designed to provide detailed answers to user queries by extracting information from external PDF documents. Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the project integrates a pre-trained language model to enhance the accuracy of responses. This project focuses on building a robust Question-Answering system capable of understanding and processing complex queries based on the content within any uploaded PDF.

Participants will gain hands-on experience with essential Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and PyTorch, which are crucial for data manipulation and deep learning tasks. The project will also cover fundamental and advanced deep learning concepts, including Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and cutting-edge Transformers. This technical foundation will help mentees understand the mechanics of natural language processing and document retrieval.

The project will tentatively be 5 weeks long.
Basic Python skills is the only hard-prerequisite. Python libraries (NumPy, pandas and matplotlib) would be preferred but not necessary. Basics of Neural Networks is a plus.
